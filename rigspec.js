// rigspec.js — the NUMBERS. One place where "how the camera moves" is a
// quantity rather than an adjective.
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
// --------------------
// The prompts said "slides steadily toward the LEFT edge" and "opens outward".
// A video model reads that and picks its own direction and its own speed, and
// the delivered sets proved it: one wall ran backwards, one ran at roughly
// three times the reference, and one had no camera move at all — just objects
// sliding over a fixed background. Prose cannot state a velocity. This file
// states velocities, total excursions, scale factors and timestamped landmark
// positions, and the prompt quotes them.
//
// WHERE THE NUMBERS COME FROM
// ---------------------------
// The four reference renders (C_PushIn, C_PushOut, C_TrackLeft, C_TrackRight).
// Each is the WHOLE 11520x2160 nDisplay canvas scaled to 1920x1080 — verified,
// not assumed: the coloured strip sits at y 360..720 and splits into three
// exactly-640px panels, which is the canvas at 1/6 scale. So
//
//     panel 1  master x [    0,  3840)  =  L (3520) + LR (320)   <- LEFT view
//     panel 2  master x [ 3840,  7680)  =  C (3840)              <- CENTRE view
//     panel 3  master x [ 7680, 11520)  =  RR (320) + R (3520)   <- RIGHT view
//
// All three views are exactly one third of the canvas. (A review pass claimed
// the side views were 4608px and every rate was therefore 2.5x wrong. It is
// not: 3520 + 320 = 3840. The only unit correction the sides need is the 1.09
// between the 3840px VIEW and the 3520px WALL the tool actually delivers, and
// that is applied below.)
//
// Each panel was decomposed frame to frame into a similarity transform
// (translation, uniform scale, rotation) fitted by RANSAC to sparse
// Lucas-Kanade correspondences, then accumulated over the clip. That is a
// different estimator from the Farneback flow in learn_rig.py, and it
// reproduced those figures to within a few percent on all twelve panel/move
// cells — which is the only reason these are quoted as measurements rather
// than as readings.
//
// THE DIRECTION QUESTION, SETTLED
// -------------------------------
// On C_PushIn the two side walls move APART: LEFT content travels to frame
// left at -31.4%/s, RIGHT content travels to frame right at +33.3%/s, while
// the centre expands x1.43/s with no lateral drift. Three independent passes
// now agree (Farneback medians, sparse LK displacement, RANSAC similarity),
// and it is what a forward dolly must do — you walk toward the far wall, and
// the side scenery flows backward past you, out of the rear end of each side
// view. Stated without left/right, which is where the confusion lives:
//
//     PUSH IN  — side walls travel from the SEAM edge toward the OUTER edge.
//     PUSH OUT — side walls travel from the OUTER edge toward the SEAM edge.
//
// (The seam edge is the one that touches the centre wall: the RIGHT edge of
// the left wall's frame, the LEFT edge of the right wall's frame.)
//
// SPEED: A RATE THE OPERATOR SETS
// -------------------------------
// This USED to freeze the total excursion, so every clip travelled the same
// distance whatever its length. That killed the "three times too far" bug but
// left no control of pace at all: a 15-second clip just crawled through the
// same gesture, and the km/h box governed nothing.
//
// The tables below are still the reference GESTURE (they fix the direction and
// the ratios between the three walls), but spec() now reads them as a rate at
// the reference's own duration and re-paces them by the speed dial, so
//
//     dx_total = dx_per_second x duration
//
// and one speed means the same thing at 4 seconds and at 15. See the speed
// dial section below for where 100% comes from and how it was measured.

// SPEED IS A RATE NOW, NOT A TOTAL. This inverts what this file used to do, and

// section 6 ("scale by total excursion, never by per-second rate").
//
// That rule existed to stop a 1.9-second reference BEAT being replayed as a
// 5-second clip's per-second rate, which asked for ~3x the travel. It solved
// that by freezing the total: every clip travelled the same distance whatever
// its length, so a 15-second clip just crawled. The operator had no control of
// pace at all - the km/h box was inert, feeding one advisory string into the
// contract and governing nothing.
//
// What the owner asked for instead: one linear speed that means the same thing
// at 4 seconds and at 15 seconds, so distance = rate x duration.
//
// WHERE 100% COMES FROM. Six operator reference clips (L_Clouds, R_Clouds,
// R_BLDG, L_grass, R_Desert, L_Desert), each measured twice - by wall_motion.py
// (RANSAC similarity) and by accumulated phase correlation. The two estimators

// of x2.00, and holding that ratio is what the gesture model does by default.
// The generator does not honour it: over three delivered sets the sides tracked
// what they were asked while the centre overshot its scale by 3-9x, and the
// centre's delivered rate barely moved with the ask at all. A set built on the
// raw reference ratio therefore lands as a fast centre between two slow sides,
// every time, whatever the speed dial says.
//
// 25 was arrived at from the wall, by the owner, watching stitched output - "the
// centre should be about 75% slower to match the sides". An earlier 65 was still
// visibly too fast. The Centre % box overrides it per scene; this is what it

// about a quarter of the nDisplay render's pace.

// Scale rides the same dial, in log space, so every ratio the reference render
// measured between the walls survives at any speed. Cross-check that this is
// not arbitrary: at 100% it puts the SIDE walls' scale at x1.0122/s, and the
// six reference clips measured x1.0113/s. Those agree to 0.1%, which is the
// only reason the centre's much larger scale is trusted to the same coupling.

// ------------------------------------------------------------------ JSON ---
// THE PROMPT FORMAT THAT ACTUALLY WORKED.
//
// The user supplied seven of their own hand-written prompts that produced
// correct camera motion, and every one of them is a JSON document with the
// camera described as a real camera: projection, yaw, a start and end
// transform, a velocity vector, easing, and a block of explicit "allow_*:
// false" locks plus a negative_prompt list. Prose versions of the same
// instruction - including the numeric prose this file emitted before - kept
// getting loosely interpreted: the right wall zoomed when it was told to
// slide, and the left wall grew furniture that was never in the plate.
//
// THE DIRECTION FIELDS, AND THE CONFUSION THEY RESOLVE
// ---------------------------------------------------
// In those working prompts, `camera.motion.type` is "pan_left_to_right" on the
// LEFT wall and "pan_right_to_left" on the RIGHT wall. Those describe the
// CAMERA, not the picture. In the same files, `environmental_fx.clouds.motion`
// - which describes CONTENT - is "right_to_left" on the left wall and
// "left_to_right" on the right wall. Camera right means content left, so both
// fields agree, and both agree with the reference renders: on a push in, the
// left wall's content travels to frame LEFT and the right wall's to frame
// RIGHT. Every round of "the direction is wrong" came from reading a camera
// field as if it were a content field.
//
// So the JSON below keeps the exact key names that worked, and adds
// `content_direction` alongside them, stated in the picture's own terms, so
// nothing has to be inferred ever again.

// NO CAMERA-FRAME VOCABULARY. THIS IS WHY.
//
// The first JSON build described the move twice: `type: "pan_left_to_right"`
// (the camera body) and `content_direction: "frame_right_to_frame_left"` (the
// picture). Those are the same move - a camera panning right makes the picture
// travel left - but only if the reader knows which frame of reference each key
// uses. The generator did not.
//
// Measured off the C_PushOut set: the RIGHT wall was asked for dx -0.665, its
// `type` read "pan_left_to_right", and it came back travelling +0.137 - the
// camera field followed, the content field ignored. The LEFT wall got the
// mirror pair and came back at +0.015, i.e. paralysed between them.
//
// So every direction statement below is now in the PICTURE's frame, and there
// is exactly one of them. `camera_direction` and `pan_*_to_*` are gone. A
// signed number plus one unambiguous word is the whole vocabulary:
//
//     dx < 0  ->  the picture travels toward FRAME_LEFT
//     dx > 0  ->  the picture travels toward FRAME_RIGHT

  // three times out of three. The wording below and the rig_context block are
  // the only things that changed, so they are load-bearing until something
  // measured says otherwise.
  //
  // THE RIGHT WALL USED TO TRAVEL THE SAME WAY AS THE LEFT ONE.
  //
  // Measured across three delivered sets (Snow, Toronto, Bear): the LEFT wall
  // obeyed its direction every time, and the RIGHT wall travelled the SAME way
  // as the left every time - asked +0.130 got -0.018, asked +0.162 got -0.364,
  // asked +0.081 got -0.179. Three for three, wrong way. Reversing it in the
  // edit is not a fix: it runs the scene's own animation backwards too, so a
  // walking animal walks backwards.
  //
  // EACH JOB SEES ONE IMAGE AND ONE PROMPT. Nothing else is uploaded - not the
  // other walls' plates, not their prompts, not their clips. So a rule phrased
  // as "the other side wall goes the opposite way" is unusable: there is no
  // other wall in front of the model to be opposite TO. A first version of this
  // field said exactly that and would have been dead text.
  //
  // What IS in front of it is the reference image, and that image already
  // carries the answer, because the two side walls are mirrored in PERSPECTIVE:
  // the left wall recedes toward its RIGHT edge, the right wall toward its
  // LEFT. Anchoring travel to the visible vanishing direction therefore comes
  // out mirrored on its own, from a rule that only ever talks about this one
  // frame. Same reason `perspective` works and never needed a sibling either.
  // ...AND THEN IT SENT THE PUSH-OUT SET THE WRONG WAY. Measured 2026-09-23,
  // C_PushOut at 100% / centre 25%, one set of three:
  //
  //     wall     asked dx     measured dx
  //     LEFT       +0.424        +0.064     right way, 15% of the distance
  //     CENTER      scale 0.896   scale 0.790  right way, 2.15x too much
  //     RIGHT      -0.424        +0.233     WRONG WAY - it performed a push in
  //
  // The mechanism is the premise, not the conclusion. This field asserts where
  // depth lies in the supplied picture, and on both side plates it asserted the
  // opposite of what the plate shows: the right wall's image has its nearest,
  // largest mass (the towers) at its LEFT edge, and the left wall's at its
  // RIGHT - in both, the near end is the SEAM, not the outer end. Told "the
  // nearest things sit at your RIGHT edge" by text and the reverse by the
  // picture, the right wall believed the picture, followed "travel into the
  // depth" toward what IT could see was far, and came out backwards.
  //
  // So the direction is no longer DERIVED from a depth reading the tool has not
  // verified. It is stated in frame terms, which need no premise and can be
  // checked against the result: which edge everything leaves by, and which edge
  // uncovers new material. `perspective` below still describes the intended
  // geometry of the set - the owner approved that and it is untouched - it just
  // no longer decides which way the camera goes.
  //
  // C_PushIn IS DELIBERATELY LEFT EXACTLY AS IT WAS. The owner confirmed it
  // from delivered output ("right motion is fixed, it's looking nice for push
  // in") after three wrong-way sets, and asked for it not to be touched. Its
  // contract is byte-identical to before this change; only the side walls on a
  // move that travels toward the SEAM - which is push-out - get the new field.
