// rig.js — the tri-wall camera RIG model.
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
// --------------------
// The original locked video rules treated each wall as an independent camera
// with its own hand-written rule: centre "dolly forward", left "truck right",
// right "truck left". Three rules, written separately, that happened to be
// pointed in sensible directions. That is why generated sets came out with the
// right topology but wrong magnitudes — nothing tied the three speeds
// together, so each job sampled its own pace.
//
// This file replaces that with ONE rig intent that DERIVES all three walls'
// rules. You state what the physical camera does; the three locked blocks fall
// out of it, already coupled, already mirror-symmetric, with the numbers
// stated explicitly in the text so the generator has something checkable.
//
// MEASURED GROUND TRUTH (see motion_probe.py, and RIG_TARGETS below)
// ------------------------------------------------------------------
// From a real UE5/nDisplay tri-wall render of a forward push-in:
//     LEFT   mean dx  -0.291   radial +0.241
//     CENTRE mean dx  -0.052   radial +0.513   parallax(near-far) -0.357
//     RIGHT  mean dx  +0.307   radial +0.125
// Read that as: a push-in is ONE RADIAL DIVERGENCE FIELD centred on the centre
// wall. Centre has ~zero net lateral flow but the strongest divergence (a true
// dolly — near and far separate). The side walls carry the motion laterally
// OUTWARD, equal and opposite, |L|/|R| = 1.06.
//
// NOBODY PUSHES IN EXCEPT CENTRE. Three walls all dollying forward is the
// failure mode this whole file exists to prevent — it does not stitch, because
// in the real room the side walls are looking sideways at a world that is
// sliding past, not toward, the viewer.
//
// From the same measurement on a Higgsfield-generated set: signs correct in all
// three seasons, but |R/L| ranged 0.72-1.85 and the side-to-centre coupling was
// ~8x too high. Those are the two numbers CALIBRATION targets.

  // That spread is exactly why this is a SETTING and not a hard constant: the

  // figure. The authoritative number comes from the room — inner-edge distance
  // divided by outer-edge distance from the eyepoint — and should be measured
  // once and set here.
  //
  // A flat, un-keystoned image on an angled wall reads as a photograph hung on
