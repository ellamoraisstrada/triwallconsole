// principles.js — the locked block, rebuilt from the Sizzle Wall Runbook.
//
// WHAT CHANGED AND WHY
// --------------------
// The old locked block had grown to ~2,900 characters per wall of prose, and it
// carried two values that were actively harmful:
//
//   "exactly 15 kilometres per hour"  — an invented number. Nothing measured it;
//       it was a placeholder that then got asserted to the generator as fact,
//       and it fought whatever the decoder actually read off a reference.
//   "exactly 15 kilometres per hour" was the only genuinely disruptive one.
//
// CORRECTION, against the wall brief: I ALSO removed "exactly 90 degrees" on the
// reasoning that the Unreal wall meshes looked like angled quads. That was
// wrong. They look angled because they are drawn in perspective from a
// free-flying editor camera. The room is a literal U — L and R ARE at 90
// degrees, and the 320px returns bridge the corners at 45. The angle is back,
// sourced from theatre.js rather than hardcoded here.
//
// Both are gone. What replaces them is the ROOM's principles, which are stable,
// and the RIG's own decoded values, which are measured. A principle that is
// true regardless of the shot belongs here; a number that depends on the shot
// comes from the rig or the decoder and is stated only when it is real.
//
// SOURCE: the Sizzle Wall Runbook's energy law, expressed in terms a generator
// can act on. The Runbook's own numbers (side temporal lag 0.33s, luminance
// ceiling 0.55 of centre's p99, coherent lateral flow cap 6 px/frame, 2 flashes
// per second over 15% of field) are POST-PROCESS parameters — they are applied
// to plates by the pipeline, not understood by an image model. Asking a video
// model for "an EMA time constant of 0.33 seconds" produces nothing. So each
// one is carried here as the behaviour it is meant to produce.

  //     reference beat's rate is not a 5-second clip's rate. The spec states a
  //     TOTAL EXCURSION and divides it by the clip length.
  //   * WHICH WAY, unambiguously. "Toward the LEFT edge" is only meaningful if
  //     you know which edge touches the centre wall, so the spec gives the
  //     sign of dx, the edge name, AND the seam relationship.

//                 continuity, but it invites the model to continue the SUBJECT
//                 too, which is how the billboard ended up on all three walls.

    + `degrees, would render.

`

    + `pushed out or panned sideways. It does NOT show the centre's subject face-on again, smaller or `
    + `further away. If your frame looks like the centre image with more room around it, or shows the same `

    + `surface or scenery lines that side. Near and large at the ${outer} edge, receding and small toward `
    + `the ${inner} edge where this wall meets the centre.

`

    + `THE SEAM STILL HAS TO MATCH. Where this wall's ${inner} edge meets the centre image's ${outerWordSeam} `
    + `edge, the two must line up as one continuous space: the same horizon or eyeline height, the same `
    + `floor or ground plane arriving at the same height and angle, the same light direction and colour, the `
    + `same medium and palette. Turning your head does not change the room you are in.

`

    + `MATCH THE MEDIUM. Whatever the centre image is made of, this wall is made of the same thing — `
    + `photographic, 3D render, cel or anime art, flat vector, painterly — with the same line weight, `
    + `outline treatment, detail level, palette and background treatment. Never a photograph beside a `
    + `drawing.

`

    + `ONE HERO, ONCE. The main character, figure, product, logo, display or landmark the piece is about `
    + `belongs to the centre wall and appears there only. Do not repeat it here, do not place a second or `
    + `smaller one further down, do not add a different one of the same kind to balance the frame, and do `
